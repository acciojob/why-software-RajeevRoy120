	  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>Becoming a developer excites me because it allows me to create, innovate, and solve real-world problems through technology. I love the challenge of coding, the logical thinking it requires, and the satisfaction of building something from scratch. Technology is constantly evolving, and being a developer means continuous learning and growth. I aspire to contribute to meaningful projects, improve user experiences, and make a positive impact in the world through software development.</p>
